summary: "Hello everyone! This is my first post so I want to write something about mathematics. As we all know mathematics is the queen of the science. Back in the early 19th century, the famous German mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss said this because mathematics has successfully revealed the nature of physical reality. Even now every person on earth living a normal life intersects with mathematics every day. Without mathematics, the world would be pure chaos. "
